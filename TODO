GOAL

* 3D top down
* model animation
* nice light system
* in game GUI simple GUI
* environment collision
* weapon shooting stuff
* netcode multiplayer
* base hideout
* traders / faction / reputation

TODO

- @game: ImGui admin interface
- @game: toggle bounding box over model
- @game: draw wireframe mode
- @game: rework model position to fit the ground?
- @game: cast mouse ray from the middle of the player?
- @game: draw circle around player?

- @game: entity system with atachable component (health, dynamic, etc ...)
- @engine: improve coordinate system for positionning objects
- @engine: implement memorypool + viz, add when heap allocated substract when delete from the heap
- @engine: make better rendering API. Less verbose?
- @engine: implement beautyfull light PBR + effects
- @engine: make the engine a static lib or something?
- @engine: fix / improve texture management from assimp model?
- @engine: assimp be carefull of texture path (need to update blender mtl file)
- @engine: find something better when loading skybox faces (from a single file ideally) + hdr

- @editor: gui switch perf to string rendering
- @editor: loader progress bar at startup editor and loading files?

- @editor/@game: improve logger system

- @game: implement a internal console with simple cli instead of imGui admin GUI?

REMEMBER

- @engine: improve ray mouse collision with modules
  -> OBB (Oriented Bounding Box) collision ?
  -> AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) collision ?
  -> Ray intersection / collision algo ?

- @general: efficient + pretty error handling
- @general: use memory block heap allocated and use offset to move around data? john blow
- @general: string const& vs const char*
- @general: opengl debug synchronous
- @general: prefer unordered map
- @general: command & observer pattern
- @general: always default values from struct, just should init ptrs at constructor
