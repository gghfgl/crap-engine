### GOAL

* 3D top down
* model animation
* nice light system
* in game GUI simple GUI
* environment collision
* weapon shooting stuff
* netcode multiplayer
* base hideout
* traders / faction / reputation

### TODO

- @: clean TODO
- @: draw circle around player?
- @: clean available default model and list
- @: animated model
- @: light
- @: collision
- @: inventory system?
- @: terrain editor?

- @: entity system with atachable component (health, dynamic, etc ...)
- @: improve coordinate system for positionning objects
- @: implement memorypool + viz, add when heap allocated substract when delete from the heap
- @: make better rendering API. Less verbose?
- @: implement beautyfull light PBR + effects
- @: make the engine a static lib or something?
- @: fix / improve texture management from assimp model?
- @: assimp be carefull of texture path (need to update blender mtl file)
- @: find something better when loading skybox faces (from a single file ideally) + hdr

- @: gui switch perf to string rendering
- @: loader progress bar at startup editor and loading files?
- @: improve logger system
- @: implement a internal console with simple cli instead of imGui admin GUI?

### REMEMBER

- @: improve ray mouse collision with modules
  -> OBB (Oriented Bounding Box) collision ?
  -> AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) collision ?
  -> Ray intersection / collision algo ?

- @: efficient + pretty error handling
- @: use memory block heap allocated and use offset to move around data? john blow
- @: string const& vs const char*
- @: opengl debug synchronous
- @: prefer unordered map
- @: command & observer pattern
- @: always default values from struct, just should init ptrs at constructor
